            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that empowers users to create interactive electronic projects. It consists of both hardware (Arduino boards) and software (Arduino IDE), allowing users to write code that can interact with various components. Originally designed for artists and designers, Arduino has gained popularity in education, DIY projects, and prototyping.</p>

            <h2>How Arduino Works</h2>
            <p>At the heart of an Arduino board is a microcontroller, which is programmed to perform specific tasks. The process begins when users write code in the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The code, written in a simplified version of C++, is uploaded to the board via a USB connection. Once uploaded, the board can interact with various sensors and devices to perform actions based on the programmed instructions.</p>

            <h2>Key Components of Arduino</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microcontroller:</strong> The main processing unit (commonly an ATmega) that executes the programmed instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Input/Output Pins:</strong> Pins that allow for digital signals (high/low) to be sent to and from the microcontroller.</li>
                <li><strong>Analog Input Pins:</strong> Used to read analog signals from sensors, measuring varying voltage levels (0 to 5V).</li>
                <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Powers the Arduino board through a USB connection or an external power supply.</li>
                <li><strong>USB Connection:</strong> Allows users to upload code and can also provide power to the board during development.</li>
                <li><strong>LED Indicator:</strong> A built-in LED to check if the board is powered and for debugging.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistor and Capacitor:</strong> Passive components used to manage current flow and stabilize voltage levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Shield:</strong> Additional boards stacked on top of an Arduino to add functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Connectors:</strong> Headers and sockets for connecting various modules, sensors, and devices.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
